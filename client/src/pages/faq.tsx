                  Our 50% advance payment model is designed to balance commitment while making luxury jewelry more 
                  accessible. For all orders (both ready-made and custom designs), we require 50% of the total price 
                  as an advance payment to begin production or secure the piece. The remaining 50% is due before 
                  shipping the final product. This policy helps us maintain our high-quality standards while 
                  providing flexibility for our customers.

                  Natural diamonds form over billions of years deep within the Earth, while lab-grown diamonds are created 
                  in controlled laboratory environments that replicate natural conditions. Chemically, physically, and 
                  optically, they are identicalâ€”both are real diamonds. The main differences are origin and price, with 
                  lab-grown diamonds typically costing 30-40% less than natural diamonds of equivalent quality. We offer 
                  both options to suit different preferences and budgets.
