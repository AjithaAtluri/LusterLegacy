                  The terms "precious" and "semi-precious" are traditional classifications that have been used for centuries, but modern gemologists recognize that this distinction is somewhat arbitrary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Historically, only diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds were considered precious, while all other gemstones were deemed semi-precious. Today, factors like rarity, durability, and market demand are more important indicators of a gemstone's value.

                  Carat is a unit of weight used specifically for gemstones, equal to 200 milligrams. Don't confuse it with "karat," which measures gold purity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While larger gemstones (higher carat weight) are generally more valuable, factors like color, clarity, and cut can influence a stone's value more significantly than size alone.

                  While natural gemstones carry the allure of rarity and tradition, lab-created stones offer ethical certainty, consistent quality, and are typically more affordable.

                  Polki refers to uncut, natural diamonds that have been used in traditional Indian jewelry for centuries. Unlike modern cut diamonds, Polki stones retain their natural character and are set with their flat side up.

                  Kundan is a traditional technique of setting gems in gold foil. This labor-intensive process creates a distinctive look that has adorned Indian royalty for generations.

                  The karat system measures the purity of gold in 24 parts. 24K gold is pure (99.9%), while 22K, 18K, and 14K contain 22, 18, and 14 parts gold, respectively, mixed with other metals.

                <p>
                  Higher karat gold (22K-24K) is more valuable but softer, while lower karat gold is more durable for everyday wear. Different jewelry pieces benefit from different karat levels based on their intended use.

                  Yellow gold is the natural color of pure gold alloyed with silver and copper. White gold contains white metals like palladium or silver, plus usually a rhodium plating. Rose gold incorporates a higher percentage of copper for its distinctive pink hue.

                  Metal allergies are most commonly reactions to nickel, which can be present in white gold and other alloys. Pure metals like 24K gold or platinum rarely cause allergic reactions.

                  For sensitive skin, consider platinum, palladium, titanium, or higher karat gold pieces that contain minimal alloys.

                  The weight of precious metals in a piece reflects its durability and investment value. Heavier pieces typically contain more precious metal and will withstand daily wear better.

                  Machine-made jewelry offers consistency and precision but may lack the character and personal touch of handcrafted pieces. The best jewelry often combines both approaches.
