Page flickering is a common frontend issue and could be caused by a variety of factors. Here are the most likely reasons and how to troubleshoot each:

🔁 1. CSS/JS Hot Reloading (During Development)
Cause: If you're using tools like Vite, Webpack (with hot module replacement), or Create React App, flickering can happen due to constant re-rendering or hot updates.

Fix:

Temporarily disable hot reload and see if it persists.

Ensure your component tree is stable and not being re-mounted on every change.

🎨 2. CSS Loading/Flashing Styles (FOUC)
Cause: Flash of unstyled content (FOUC) happens if styles are loaded after content.

Fix:

Ensure critical CSS is loaded inline or early in the <head>.

Avoid loading styles via JavaScript when possible.

With Tailwind or external stylesheets, preload them properly.

⚛️ 3. React State/Effect Issues
Cause: If you're using useEffect without proper dependency arrays or toggling state too frequently, your components might unmount/remount, causing flicker.

Fix:

Check if useEffect or useState is causing re-renders unnecessarily.

Use React DevTools to inspect re-renders.

🧱 4. Layout Shifts Due to Images or Fonts
Cause: Loading images or web fonts without proper sizing can shift layout.

Fix:

Set explicit width and height on all <img> tags.

Use font-display: swap; for web fonts.

Use a loader like next/image (if using Next.js).

🖼️ 5. Animations or Transitions
Cause: Improper use of animation or transition in CSS can cause flickering.

Fix:

Check if animations have infinite or misconfigured durations.

Try removing animations temporarily to isolate the issue.

🔌 6. Third-Party Scripts
Cause: Ads, analytics, or tracking scripts can block rendering or inject styles after page load.

Fix:

Defer or async load non-critical scripts.

Use Chrome DevTools to identify blocking scripts.

🧪 Debug Tip
Open DevTools > Performance tab > Record — look for "Recalculate Style", "Layout", and "Paint" spikes. It will help you pinpoint the flickering source.
